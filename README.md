## Data Analysis of a Kaggle Playground Dataset of Steel Plate Defects
### 1. Description
The project from Kaggle Playground Series that I wanted to share in my portfolio due to work I've put to obtain beautiful joyplots.

### 2. Lessons learned
I've learned how to make colorful and appealing joyplots. But first of all I learned that they're not the best choice if you want to gather a solid understanding of your dataset.
For example histograms can give you a more detailed view of the continuous variables in your dataset.
